Docker- containerize applications

docker uses same os,hardeware
docker image are very lightweight
VM -will take more place, different os

commands
•	docker pull
•	docker run
docker run -it ubuntu -?to make the docker for aome time . it - interactive attach -attach local terminal to docker image.
•	docker ps command - to list all the running container
•	docker stop {container id or name}
•	docker start
•	docker logs {containerid}
•	docker exec -used to run image command inside image pull done
sudo docker exec -it 49ec08e046f2 {bash,ls,cat ,any commands we can run}  === inside image
to see docker image inside local system or ec2 that means if you want to see where docker image has been pulled then use docker exec -it {containerid} command
to create file inside nginx docker image -update apt -apt update, then install vim if vim is not there
then vim testfile.txt
•	docker inspect {container id}- gives the information about the container itself
•	docker rmi  {image id}  -to remove all tangling images from docker
•	docker image prune ->to remove all the dangling images
•	docker  rm  $(docker ps -aq)->after docker is stop it still present in memory may be for future use . to remove those use this command
•	docker ps -aq ->to get only container ids

docker image to pull in ec2
create ec2 then connect and run below commands
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install docker -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user

Pull a Simple Docker Image (Nginx)
docker pull nginx


This pulls the official Nginx image from Docker Hub.

4️⃣ Verify the Image
docker images


You should see nginx listed.

This error means your current user does not have permission to access the Docker daemon socket (/var/run/docker.sock) on your Amazon EC2 instance.

Docker requires either:

sudo access
OR

Your user to be part of the docker group

✅ Quick Fix (Immediate)

Run the command with sudo:

sudo docker pull nginx


If this works, the issue is confirmed: it's a permissions problem.

✅ Permanent Fix (Recommended)

Add your user to the docker group so you don’t need sudo every time.

1️⃣ Add user to docker group

If you're using Amazon Linux:

sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user


If you're using Ubuntu:

sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

2️⃣ Log out and log back in

This step is required.

Exit SSH:

exit


Then reconnect:

ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip

3️⃣ Test Without sudo
docker pull nginx


It should now work without permission errors.

🔎 Why This Happens

Docker runs as a service and controls the socket:

/var/run/docker.sock


Only:

root

users in the docker group

can access it.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Pulling the Nginx image is not enough — you must run it and expose port 80 on your Amazon EC2 instance.

Follow these exact steps 👇

✅ Step 1: Run Nginx and Map Port 80

On your EC2 instance:

docker run -d -p 80:80 --name mynginx nginx


This means:

First 80 → EC2 machine port

Second 80 → Nginx container port

✅ Step 2: Allow Port 80 in EC2 Security Group (VERY IMPORTANT)

Go to:

AWS Console → EC2 → Security Groups → Inbound Rules

Add rule:

Type	Protocol	Port	Source
HTTP	TCP	80	0.0.0.0/0

Save it.

Without this, browser cannot access your server.

✅ Step 3: Get Your EC2 Public IP

Run:

curl ifconfig.me


OR check in AWS console.

Example:

3.110.25.100

✅ Step 4: Open in Browser

Type:

http://your-ec2-public-ip


Example:

http://3.110.25.100


You should see:

Welcome to nginx!

🔎 If It Doesn't Work

Check these:

1️⃣ Is container running?
docker ps


You should see 0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp

2️⃣ Is port 80 already used?
sudo lsof -i :80

3️⃣ Check container logs
docker logs mynginx

⚡ Quick Checklist

✔ Docker running
✔ Container running
✔ -p 80:80 used
✔ Security group allows port 80
✔ Using public IP
