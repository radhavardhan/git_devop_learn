cloudfront service  will help to imporove the performance of web application
visualization -quicksight
on-premises -private cloud
to deploy virtual machine is client loaction is best as latency will be less
installation of patch on the os is AWS responsiblity -when paas , saas
installation of patch on the os is user when iaas
AMI (amzon machine image)-reusable
EC2 - saving plan instance- if a load is predictable ,on an avergae workload and can use for 2 to 3 years then use this
reserved instance -if load is predictable but if spiked up then use this
dedecated host-if licsence is there then use
on-demand instances - sceneraio like testing then use this
spot instance- task is nit importentent and it can be interiptuded
snapshots =incremental data backup
snapchat 1st is the entire backup but after that only incremental backup
storage  -object -s3

VPC

subnet, route,internet gateway
by defaoult all AWS resoiurce are created in defult VPC
we can create our own VPC
steps - 1.create VPC 2.create EC2 in VPC(your VPC)-public subnet
               3. create subnets(public and private)Note: coucious on CIDR IP allocation
               4.create Internet gateway because to access EC2 server we need IP to access internet. after creating IG attach to VPC(your VPC)
               5.create routtable and associate with subnet then add route for internet gateway to public subnet where EC2 created.
               6. create NAT gateway in public subnet to give access to AWS services present in privarte subnet. through internet gateway we can access

if any service want to associte our VPC then this endponits are used
2 VPC end points
1.gateway endpoint(free srvice) -s3,dynamo db
2.interface endpoint(paid service) - if want to connect with any other AWS services

NACL is firewal at subnet level(vpc)
Security group is firewall at instance level(ec2).
security group is statefull (if inbound allowed autometically outbound rukle is allowed). NACL is- stateless(we need to configure inbound and outbound)
